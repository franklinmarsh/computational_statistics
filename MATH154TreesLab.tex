> # In addition to using the kaggle data, load the data set mtcars into R via the
> # command data(mtcars). Try to predict the fuel efficiency (mpg) via a regression tree, and try to predict the transmission type (automatic or manual) via a classification
> # tree.
> #You may want to compare the regression tree to a linear model.
> # plot(mtcars) will give you all the pairwise scatter plots. Notice that most of the
> # relationships with MPG are non-linear.
> 
> # Additionally, R has a package called randomForest. The most useful function,
> # which implements the algorithm discussed in class, is of the same name. Compare
> # the classification rates for a random forest to that of a simple tree.
